# pretext-tools README

A Visual Studio Code extension to make writing PreTeXt documents easier.

## Features

So far, pretext-tools includes:
- Some basic additions to xml grammar specific to pretext, such as recognizing math as LaTeX and "hiding" permid attributes as comments.
- A large collection of snippets.
- Commands via the command pallet (Ctrl+Shift+P) to quickly call commands from the [PreTeXt-CLI](https://github.com/PreTeXtBook/pretext-cli).  To use these, you need to have python and the PreTeXt-CLI installed (using `pip install pretextbook`).
